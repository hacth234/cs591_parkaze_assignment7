ATTACK: ' or TRUE#

1. The Blind SQL Injection. I injected (' or TRUE#) without the parenthesis, which is queried as (search='' or TRUE#). This boolean condition will return TRUE, and since # is the comment delimiter for sql, everything after TRUE will be commented out allowing us to successfully view all of the things in the database.

2. My application is not vulnerable to this type of attack because Firebase is a noSQL based cloud storage where everything is stored as JSON objects.

3. Two ways to protect against this vulnerability is to not use SQL based databases, or to properly sanitize inputs into the form.
